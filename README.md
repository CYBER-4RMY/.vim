<h1 align="center">Vim C0nf</h1>

## Prefetch...

- This is the minimal configuration for a daliy user of vim.
- Well... I know every linux user want customization but some time simplicity matters the most.
- Now take a look.....

---

## Installation...

1. Copy the repository to your local machine using this...
```BASH
    git clone https://github.com/CYBER-4RMY/.vim.git
```
2. Now just make or edit your **.vimrc** form `/home/$USER/.vimrc` or `~/.vimrc` & add this line to it.
```VIM
    source ~/.vim/vimrc
```
3. Well that's all now you can get a difference between your previous vim and recent vim.
