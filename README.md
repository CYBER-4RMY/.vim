## 🛠️ Installation:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CYBER-4RMY/.vim.git ~/.vim
    ```
2.  **Configure Global `.vimrc`:**
    Create or edit your global `.vimrc` file (typically `~/.vimrc` or `/home/$USER/.vimrc`) and add the following line to source this configuration:
    ```vim
    source ~/.vim/vimrc
    ```
3.  **Install Essential Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have `fzf` and `Vim` (version 8.1 or higher for `terminal` command) installed. For Python linting, `flake8` is needed.
    *   **For Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S fzf vim`
    *   **For Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install fzf vim`
    *   **For Fedora/RHEL:** `sudo dnf install fzf vim`
    *   **For Python Linting:** `pip install flake8`

## ⌨️ All Keybindings (`keybinds.vim`):

The `<leader>` key is mapped to `space`. All keybindings are `nnoremap` unless specified.

### General Navigation & Window Management:

*   `<leader>cd`: Open Vim's built-in file explorer (`:Ex`).
*   `<C-v>`: Split current window vertically.
*   `<C-s>`: Split current window horizontally.
*   `<C-h>`: Move focus to the window on the left.
*   `<C-j>`: Move focus to the window below.
*   `<C-k>`: Move focus to the window above.
*   `<C-l>`: Move focus to the window on the right.

### Fuzzy Finding (FZF Enhancements):

*   `<leader>f`: Fuzzy find files in the current project (`:Files`).
*   `<leader>b`: Fuzzy find and switch between open buffers (`:Buffers`).
*   `<leader>h`: Fuzzy find and execute commands from history (`:History`).

> **Note on FZF Commands (`<leader>a`, `<leader>l`, `<leader>gc`):**
> Due to the preference of not installing external plugins from GitHub, advanced FZF commands like `:Ag` (project-wide text search), `:Lines` (search in buffers), and `:Commits` (git commit history) are not available in this configuration. The keybindings for these commands (`<leader>a`, `<leader>l`, `<leader>gc`) have been removed from `keybinds.vim` to avoid confusion.


### Autocompletion:

*   `Q` (normal mode): Reformat selected text or current paragraph (`gq`).
*   `<C-U>` (insert mode): Deletes text from cursor to start of line, but each deletion is a separate undoable action (`<C-G>u<C-U>`).

### Code Folding:

*   `<leader>ft`: Toggle a fold (open/close) under the cursor (`za`).
*   `<leader>fo`: Open all folds in the current file (`zR`).
*   `<leader>fc`: Close all folds in the current file (`zM`).

### Session Management:

*   `<leader>ss`: Save the current session (open files, window layout, etc.) to a file named `Session.vim` in the current directory (`:mksession! Session.vim`).
*   `<leader>sl`: Load a session from a file named `Session.vim` in the current directory (`:source Session.vim`).

### Quickfix List Navigation:

*   `<leader>co`: Open the quickfix window to view a list of errors/warnings.
*   `<leader>cc`: Close the quickfix window.
*   `<leader>cn`: Jump to the next item in the quickfix list.
*   `<leader>cp`: Jump to the previous item in the quickfix list.

### Spell Checking:

*   `<leader>sn`: Move to the next misspelled word (`]s`).
*   `<leader>sp`: Move to the previous misspelled word (`[s`).
*   `<leader>sa`: Add the word under the cursor to the spell file (`zg`).
*   `<leader>sw`: Mark the word under the cursor as a spelling mistake (`zw`).
*   `<leader>ss`: Show spelling suggestions for the word under the cursor (`z=`).

### Competitive Programming:

*   `<leader>c`: Compiles the current file (`:Compile`).
*   `<leader>r`: Runs the compiled/interpreted program in a new terminal (`:Run`).
*   `<leader>cr`: Compiles (if applicable) and then runs the program (`:CompileAndRun`).
*   `<leader>ti`: Creates an empty `input.txt` file in the current directory (`:CreateInputFile`).
*   `<leader>te`: Creates an empty `expected_output.txt` file in the current directory (`:CreateExpectedOutputFile`).
*   `<leader>td`: Runs your program with `input.txt` as stdin, saves output to `output.txt`, and opens a diff view with `expected_output.txt` (`:RunAndDiff`).

### Git Integration:

*   `<leader>gs`: Show `git status` output in a new horizontal split terminal (`:split | terminal git status`).
*   `<leader>gd`: Show `git diff` for the current file (`%`) in a new vertical split terminal (`:vsplit | terminal git diff %`).

## 📊 Custom Status Line (`statusline.vim`):

Your status line, displayed at the bottom of the Vim window, provides a clean overview of your current context:

*   **Left Section:**
    *   Full path to the current file.
    *   `[+]` indicator if the file has been modified.
    *   `[RO]` indicator if the file is read-only.
*   **Right Section:**
    *   Filetype of the current buffer (e.g., `python`, `cpp`).
    *   Current line number and total lines (e.g., `10/100`).
    *   Percentage through the file (e.g., `10%`).
    *   Current column number.

## 🎯 Filetype Specific Features:

This configuration leverages Vim's built-in filetype plugins to provide tailored enhancements for various languages. These features are automatically enabled via `filetype plugin indent on` in `options.vim`.

### Python:

*   **Linting with `:make`**:
    *   **Functionality**: Check your Python code for errors and style issues using `flake8`.
    *   **Setup**: Ensure `flake8` is installed (`pip install flake8`).
    *   **Usage**: While in a Python file, run the command `:make`. This executes `flake8 %` and populates the quickfix list.
    *   **Navigation**: Use **Quickfix Navigation** keybindings (`<leader>co` to open, `<leader>cn` to jump to next error) to navigate issues.
*   **Omni Completion**: Use `<C-x C-o>` in insert mode for intelligent code completion.
*   **Navigation**: `]]` and `[[` jump between classes/functions; `]m` and `[m` jump to next/previous methods.
*   **Documentation**: Press `K` on a keyword to open its documentation (`pydoc`).

### C/C++:

*   **Omni Completion**: Use `<C-x C-o>` in insert mode for intelligent code completion.
*   **Navigation**: `%` jumps between `#if`/`#elif`/`#else`/`#endif` blocks.
*   **Documentation**: Press `K` on a keyword to open its man page in a new terminal window.

### HTML:

*   **Omni Completion**: Use `<C-x C-o>` in insert mode for intelligent HTML tag completion.
*   **Navigation**: `%` jumps between opening and closing HTML tags.
*   **Folding**: HTML tags are automatically folded; `za` toggles folds.

### Go:

*   **Formatting**: Use `gq` to format your Go code with `gofmt`.
*   **Navigation**: `]]` and `[[` jump between `func`/`type` blocks.
*   **Documentation**: Press `K` on a keyword to look up its documentation (`go doc`).

### Shell:

*   **Navigation**: `%` jumps between `if`/`fi`, `for`/`done`, and `case`/`esac` blocks.
*   **Documentation**: Press `K` on a command to look up its man page.
*   **Linting**: If `shellcheck` is installed, run it on your script with the `:make` command to find potential errors.

---

## 🔌 Local Plugins (`plugins/`):

These are self-contained plugins residing in your `~/.vim/plugins/` directory.

*   `compiler.vim`: Provides commands (`:Compile`, `:Run`, `:CompileAndRun`, `:CreateInputFile`, `:CreateExpectedOutputFile`, `:RunAndDiff`) for competitive programming workflows.
*   `fzf.vim`: Integrates the core `fzf` fuzzy finder functionality, providing commands like `:Files`, `:Buffers`, `:History`. Note that advanced commands like `:Ag` (project-wide text search), `:Lines` (search in buffers), and `:Commits` (git commit history) are not available as they require the full `fzf.vim` plugin distribution from GitHub.
*   `mod_ff.vim`: (Functionality derived from its name, likely file manipulation or formatting related).
*   `tohtml.vim`: Enables the `:TOhtml` command to convert the current buffer to an HTML file with syntax highlighting.
*   `matchit` (auto-loaded): Enhances `%` command to jump between matching constructs (HTML/XML tags, #if/#endif, etc.).
*   `termdebug` (auto-loaded, if debugger support is available): Vim's built-in terminal debugger, integrating `gdb` for C/C++ debugging.
